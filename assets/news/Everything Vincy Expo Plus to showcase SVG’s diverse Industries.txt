Everything Vincy Expo Plus to showcase SVG’s diverse Industries

The 2023 edition of Everything Vincy Expo Plus is about showcasing what St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) has to offer says Chairman of Invest SVG Anthony Regisford.

This year, the Everything Vincy Expo will run from October 26 to 29 and will be held at the tarmac of the decommissioned ET Joshua Airport at Arnos Vale.

There is a website, everythingvincy.com and according to Regisford, the expo speaks directly to the government’s push towards building a many sided economy that can move the country forward.

An overview of the 2023 expo says it will showcase an extensive array of industries including agriculture, technology, fashion and art.

There will be traditional music and dance by local talent while persons will be able to meet with industry leaders and entrepreneurs. The event will feature a fashion show where local designers will showcase their apparel through runway presentations while there will be a “carefully curated” art exhibition.

The opening ceremony takes place at 10 a.m. on Thursday October 26 and the expo hours will be between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. A gala event will take place on October 27 from 7 p.m. while the art exhibition runs from October 26 to 29. There will also be workshops.

Speaking at the launch on Wednesday, Regisford said Invest SVG has an important role to play in local business promotion and as a result, the agency is going to double down on their export promotion and marketing mandate.

He noted that the organisation was given this mandate and it is true to say, that they have not yet structured themselves in way they can fully push the throttle forward and make a meaningful difference in export promotion.

“…And, we are going to strengthen the export promotion and marketing area,” Regisford stressed while noting also that digital and financial literacy is important.
